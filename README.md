**Custom printf Implementation in C**
This project presents a custom implementation of the printf function in the C programming language. It is a powerful and versatile function commonly used for formatting and displaying data in various output streams. By creating a custom implementation, I aimed to gain a deeper understanding of how this function works and to provide an example of its core functionality.

**Features**

**** This implementation supports various format specifiers, allowing you to format and display data in different ways.

**** Variable Arguments: Just like the standard printf function, this custom implementation can accept a variable number of arguments based on the format specifiers provided.

**Getting Started**

To use this custom printf implementation in your project, you can follow these steps:

**Clone the Repository:**

bash
Copy code
git clone [https://github.com/abdurahim-H/printf.git]

**Include the Header File:**

Include the custom_printf.h header file in your source code:

****Copy code
#include "custom_printf.h"

**Use the Function:**

You can use the custom_printf function in your code, just like the standard printf function. For example:

****Copy code
custom_printf("Hello, %s! This is a custom implementation of printf.\n", "User");

**Compile and Run:**

Compile your code, linking it with the custom printf implementation, and run the program.

**Example**

Here's an example of how to use the custom printf function:

****Copy code
#include "custom_printf.h"

int main() {
    custom_printf("This is an example: %d + %d = %d\n", 5, 3, 5 + 3);
    return 0;
}
